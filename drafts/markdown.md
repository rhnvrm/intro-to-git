#About
Markdown is a markup language created by John Gruber. It was designed to be easy to create readable scripts that can be converted to HTML. The only thing you need is a simple text editor such as notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Mac. Text files are easy to use editors because they are simple and to the point thus eliminating most, if not all, distractions making the user a force for productivity. Plus, all text files can be read using any computer system without a glitch. Markdown is also perfect for writing a blog post without the hassle of learning HTML. People have also used Markdown for organizing their notes, creating to-do lists, creating presentations and much more.
